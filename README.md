# Student-Performance Analysis using Python

This project conducts an in-depth statistical analysis of student performance data, focusing on modeling Grade Point Average (GPA) using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. The analysis includes comprehensive diagnostic tests to validate the regression model and ensure its reliability.

üìà Analysis Overview

The primary objective of this project is to model students' GPA based on various predictors and assess the validity of the model through several statistical tests:

OLS Regression: Establishes the relationship between GPA and independent variables.

t-test: Evaluates the significance of individual regression coefficients.

F-test: Assesses the overall significance of the regression model.

Durbin-Watson (DW) Test: Detects the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals.

Jarque-Bera (JB) Test: Tests whether the residuals are normally distributed.

Skewness and Kurtosis: Measures the asymmetry and peakedness of the residual distribution.

Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC): Provides metrics for model selection, balancing model fit and complexity.

üìÑ Dataset Description

The dataset Student_performance_data_.csv includes various features that may influence student GPA. While specific variable descriptions are not provided, typical features in such datasets may include:

Demographic Information: Age, gender, ethnicity.

Academic Records: Previous grades, attendance, study hours.

Socioeconomic Factors: Parental education, family income.

Behavioral Aspects: Participation in extracurricular activities, disciplinary records.

Note: For precise variable definitions, please refer to the dataset or accompanying documentation.

üìä Key Findings

Significant Predictors: Certain variables showed a strong correlation with GPA, indicating their potential impact on academic performance.

Model Validity: Diagnostic tests confirmed the reliability of the regression model, with residuals displaying normal distribution and no significant autocorrelation.

Model Selection: AIC and BIC values were used to compare different models, aiding in selecting the most appropriate one.
